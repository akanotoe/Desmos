# Desmos
Various Desmos projects I've made. While I can't embed each project here, I provide a link and a description of each project below.

## [Bessel functions J and Y](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/holfafu5zh?invertedColors)
Taylor series plots of the Bessel functions of the first (*J~&alpha;~*) and second (*Y~&alpha;~*) kind.

## [Complex Fourier Series Waves](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/g6re5egglg?invertedColors)
Animated Fourier series as projections of a curve in the complex plane.

## [Damped-driven oscillator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/y7q6colulj?invertedColors)
Resonance graphs for the classical damped-driven oscillator.

## [Elastic Collisions by Geometry](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/q0px86rzqm?invertedColors)
Geometric solution in phase space for a collision between two objects. Based on the 3Blue1Brown [video](https://youtu.be/jsYwFizhncE)

## [Fibonacci Numbers Extended](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cpu9oqpndj?invertedColors)
A cute little module that extends the Fibonacci sequence and the Lucas numbers to noninteger indices.

## [Finite Square Well Solution](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qv2oyweian?invertedColors)
Graphical solution to the quantum mechanical finite square well.

## [Fourier Transform Visualized](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zhfqo6mmqb?invertedColors)
Based on the 3Blue1Brown [video](https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY), this showcases the geometric intuition behind the Fourier transform. Included are functions for square waves, sawtooth waves, and triangular waves. The function *f*(*t*) can be customized to the user's liking.

## [Heat Equation Solutions](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jm0wguklxe?invertedColors)
Animated solutions to the heat equation, based on the 3Blue1Brown [video](https://youtu.be/ToIXSwZ1pJU).

## [Hermite functions and the QHO](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vxpuwbythz?invertedColors)
Plots of the solutions to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for the simple harmonic oscillator.

## [Legendre Polynomials](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kh14bquiai?invertedColors)
Recursively defined Legendre Polynomials with graphs.

## [Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0bu98a8yoo?invertedColors)
Interactive Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds for an ideal gas.

## [Venus Pentagram](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2lep41lbbk?invertedColors)
A lovely plot of the [Pentagram of Venus](http://eqnoftheday.com/the-pentagram-of-venus/).
