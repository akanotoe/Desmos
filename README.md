# Desmos
Various Desmos projects I've made. While I can't embed each project here, I provide a link and a description of each project below.

## [Bessel functions J and Y](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ievqtywfk5)
Taylor series plots of the Bessel functions of the first (*J*) and second (*Y*) kind.

## [Damped-driven oscillator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/y7q6colulj)
Resonance graphs for the classical damped-driven oscillator.

## [Fibonacci Numbers Extended](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cpu9oqpndj)
A cute little module that extends the Fibonacci sequence and the Lucas numbers to noninteger indices.

## [Finite Square Well Solution](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qv2oyweian)
Graphical solution to the quantum mechanical finite square well.

## [Fourier Transform Visualized](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/exhbaz9mpf)
Based on the 3Blue1Brown [video](https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY), this showcases the geometric intuition behind the Fourier transform. Included are functions for square waves, sawtooth waves, and triangular waves. The function $f(t)$ can be customized to the user's liking.

## [Heat Equation Solutions](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jm0wguklxe)
Animated solutions to the heat equation, based on the 3Blue1Brown [video](https://youtu.be/ToIXSwZ1pJU).

## [Venus Pentagram](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8jvl6b2k0t)
A lovely plot of the [Pentagram of Venus](http://eqnoftheday.com/the-pentagram-of-venus/).
